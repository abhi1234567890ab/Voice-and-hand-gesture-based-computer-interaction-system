# Voice-and-hand-gesture-based-computer-interaction-system
Voice and Hand Gesture-Based Interaction System in Python uses OpenCV, Mediapipe, and SpeechRecognition for hands-free control. Users perform tasks like moving the cursor, closing tabs, and zooming with hand gestures, while voice commands enable system control. Ideal for intuitive, touchless computing.
